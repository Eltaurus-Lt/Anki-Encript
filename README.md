# Anki Encrypt
A toolkit for securely learning passwords with Anki, without exposing their plain form to anyone accessing the flashcards. The toolkit includes an add-on to insert encrypted data into Anki Cards, and a JS script to check the correctness of typed answers. It can be used with stock Anki typing Cards or with any Cards that use the [stock typing method](https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/fields.html#checking-your-answer). There is also a dedicated Card Template (imported from the `.apkg` file), which comes with additional features, such as concealing answers typed during reviews and adding hints displayed on hover, but otherwise remains minimalistic and lightweight, so to be easily customised and built upon:

The passwords are encrypted using the SHA-256 algorithm. It is [reasonably secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function_security_summary), but (especially if passwords themselves are short, common, or otherwise weak) still not 100% invulnerable. It is probably a good idea to only use this method for learning passwords to forums, web services, and other accounts that do not have sensitive information attached, but not for things like bank credentials or marketplaces with saved credit card data.
Because the passwords are not explicitly saved anywhere, the Cards will only show if the answer typed during the reviews is correct or not. By design, they cannot detail specific errors in submitted answers, as regular Anki typing Cards do, or otherwise remind you what the correct answer is. To make sure nothing essential will be lost, if a password is forgotten, it should be preserved with other methods outside Anki or be easily resettable. Setting the [Leech action](https://docs.ankiweb.net/leeches.html#leeches) to `Tag Only` and all review intervals to the lowest values for a password Deck will also help, keeping the retention as high as possible.

### known issues
The Encrypt button does not work from the Editor window used for creating new cards â€” only from the Editor for browsing existing Cards.
